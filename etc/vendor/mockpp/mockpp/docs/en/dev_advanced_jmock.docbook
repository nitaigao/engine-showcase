<title>Chainable Mock Objects</title>

<sect3>
<title>Overview</title>

<para>Specifying some behaviour with chainable mock objects is similar to describing
it in words. You may say for example:

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>I <emphasis>expect</emphasis> some method invocation exactly
            <emphasis>once</emphasis></listitem>
  <listitem>This must happen <emphasis>after</emphasis> another invocation
            labeled "other-ident"</listitem>
  <listitem>The method must be called <emphasis>with</emphasis> a value
            <emphasis>equal</emphasis> to 321</listitem>
  <listitem>Then the method <emphasis>will</emphasis> return 123</listitem>
  <listitem>This invocation has an <emphasis>identifier</emphasis> called "ident"</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

In C++ code you might express the same like this:

<programlisting>

  chainer.expects(once())
         .with(new IsEqual&lt;int>(321))
         .after("other-ident")
         .will(new ReturnStub(123))
         .id("ident");

</programlisting>

You need not provide all of these methods, only what you actually need. If you don't intend
to return a special value: omit <methodname>will()</methodname> and the default return value
will be used.</para>

<para>For void methods you may apply <methodname>isVoid()</methodname> instead of
<methodname>will()</methodname> to explicitly
express this fact.</para>

<para>When a method is invoked on a chainable mock object, the mock object searches
through its expectations from first to last to find one that matches the
invocation. An expectation matches an invocation if all of its
matching rules match the invocation. After the invocation, the matching expectation
might stop matching
further invocations. For example, an <methodname>expects(once())</methodname>
expectation only matches once and will be ignored on future invocations while an
<methodname>expects(atLeastOnce())</methodname>
expectation will always be matched against invocations.</para>

<para>The original java implementation contained an additional method called
<methodname>method()</methodname> which passed the desired method name.
This is completely missing in my C++ implementation. The reason is
simple: C++ does not support reflection and therefor an application can't look into itself or
create methods at runtime or do some other weird things. So I had to apply a handful of
macro-magic and templates instead. This led to the
fact that you have to set up a different helper object for <emphasis>each method</emphasis>
whereas jMock would use the same object for all calls of a mock object.</para>

<para>A note about the internals: each chain link returns a temporary builder object with
its own set of methods to influence the mocked method and object. See directory
<filename>builder</filename> for most of the files. The first
method <methodname>expects()</methodname> returns
an object of type <classname>InvocationMockerBuilder</classname> which provides method
<methodname>with()</methodname>. And  the last method returns a type
<classname>IdentityBuilder</classname> which contains <methodname>id()</methodname>.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Stubs And Expectations</title>

<para>Chainable mock objects provide <emphasis>stubbed</emphasis> and
<emphasis>expected</emphasis> methods. An expected method must occur as
specified, otherwise the object will fail when verified. A stubbed method
without specification may be invoked unlimited times or not at all
but the test still passes.</para>

<para>In general, you will <emphasis>stub</emphasis> when you want to get some
return value from a method whereas you <emphasis>expect</emphasis> when
you intend to check the input parameters to a method. When invoked with a
specification both methods do internally the same but you should use the correct one
to express your intention.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Invocation Matchers</title>

<para>The parameter to the methods <methodname>expects()</methodname> and
<methodname>stubs()</methodname> must be some kind of invocation counter. The
current release covers the most common cases with a set of classes. However these classes
should not be used directly as they are not very readable. You should use one of the
wrapper functions instead:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><methodname>InvokeOnceMatcher</methodname> = <methodname>once()</methodname>: exactly one single invocation</listitem>
  <listitem><methodname>InvokeCountMatcher</methodname> = <methodname>exactly()</methodname>: an exact invocation count</listitem>
  <listitem><methodname>InvokeAtLeastMatcher</methodname> = <methodname>atLeast()</methodname>: a minimum invocation count</listitem>
  <listitem><methodname>InvokeAtLeastOnceMatcher</methodname> = <methodname>atLeastOnce()</methodname>: invoke the method at least once</listitem>
  <listitem><methodname>InvokeAtMostMatcher</methodname> = <methodname>atMost()</methodname>: a maximum invocation count</listitem>
  <listitem><methodname>never()</methodname>: never invoke this method</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>After setting up the behaviour and actually invoking the mock object the matcher specifications
are processed one after the other in the order given in your source file. So if you wanted to return
three different values 111, 222 and 333 you would write:

<programlisting>

  chainer.stubs(once()).will(new ReturnStub(111));
  chainer.stubs(once()).will(new ReturnStub(222));
  chainer.stubs(once()).will(new ReturnStub(333));

</programlisting>

For obvious reasons you should not use <methodname>atLeast()</methodname> in the first expectation
as is this would render the following lines useless.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Invocation Order</title>

<para>Every single invocation to one of your mock objects may be labeled with a unique
identifier. This identifier may then be used to determine that another invocation
must happen prior or after it. You may as well demand that this decision has to be based
on an invocation to a totally different mock object. And it is also possible
to add more than one call to
<methodname>before()</methodname> or <methodname>after()</methodname> if you want to
have it match against more than one invocation in the same expectation chain.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3  id="parameter-constraint">
<title>Parameter Constraints</title>

<para>When working with a <classname>VisitableMockObject</classname>
you normally specify exactly which parameter value you expect. A
<classname>ChainableMockObject</classname>
on the other hand can work less strict. Specifying an exact match is common but
you may as well allow a set of values or even any value.
Or you demand that each value must be higher than the one in the
previous invocation.</para>

<para>The distribution already contains a set of classes for common
constraints. For convenience reasons and to enhance readability most of these
classes have a counterpart in the form of a wrapper function. The most important
ones are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><classname>IsEqual</classname> = <methodname>eq()</methodname> tests equality</listitem>
  <listitem><classname>IsSame</classname> = <methodname>same()</methodname> tests if two objects are the same</listitem>
  <listitem><classname>IsCloseTo</classname> = <methodname>eq(a,b)</methodname> tests near equality</listitem>
  <listitem><classname>IsGreaterThan</classname> = <methodname>gt()</methodname> is true for higher values a reference value</listitem>
  <listitem><classname>IsLessThan</classname> = <methodname>lt()</methodname> is true for lower values than a reference value</listitem>
  <listitem><classname>IsNot</classname> = <methodname>logic_not()</methodname> negates another contraint</listitem>
  <listitem><classname>And</classname> = <methodname>logic_and()</methodname> provides a logical-and of two constraints</listitem>
  <listitem><classname>Or</classname> = <methodname>logic_or()</methodname> provides a logical-or of two constraints</listitem>
  <listitem><classname>IsAnything</classname> = <methodname>any()</methodname> is always true</listitem>
  <listitem><classname>IsNothing</classname> = <methodname>nothing()</methodname> is never true</listitem>
  <listitem><classname>StringContains</classname> = <methodname>stringContains()</methodname> checks for the occurrence of a substring</listitem>
  <listitem><classname>IsInstanceOf</classname> = <methodname>isA()</methodname> tests if an object is of a type</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Creating your own constraints is quite easy. Look at the files in the
<filename>constraint</filename> directory to get an idea how this can be done.

<note>
<title>Caution with side effects</title>
<para>One might try to to combine two contraints using <methodname>logic_or()</methodname>
or <methodname>logic_and()</methodname> respectively the according classes
<classname>Or</classname> or <classname>And</classname>:

<programlisting>

  mock.foo(logic_and&lt;int>( eq&lt;int>(0), outBound&lt;int>(42)));

</programlisting>

Unfortunately the resulting behaviour might not be as expected. By default the
evaluation of the two contstriaints is shortcut. This means that the second
constraint is not evaluated when the result is determined after the first. This
is intended as it is the default behaviour in C/C++:

<programlisting>

  if(evalA() &amp;&amp; evalB())
     ...

</programlisting>

<function>evalB()</function> is not executed if <function>evalA()</function> is
false because this would not change the program flow anymore.</para>

<para>In this case the second constraint is called one to little. If you need a
more determined behaviour when all constraints are evaluated you can pass a third
parameter which is set to <token>false</token> and enforces full evaluation.
</para>
<!--  -->
</note>



</para>

<para>Use method <methodname>with()</methodname> to pass the constraints. Obviously this
method has the same number of parameters as your mocked method.</para>

<sect4  id="outbound-constraint">
<title>Outbound Values</title>

<para id="outbound">There are special constraints which are not actually real constraints.
<classname>OutBound</classname> does not check for incoming parameter values but
passes values back by a reference. This enables mocked methods like the following:

<programlisting linenumbering="numbered">

  void getByReference(int &amp;ra)
  {
     ra = 123;
  }

</programlisting>

The values are returned one after the other. Please understand that for chainable
mock objects this is probably not the desired behaviour as the values are already
stored when the parameters are just evaluated. The intended application is for
visitable mock objects.

</para>

<para>
Similarly there is <classname>TriggeredOutBound</classname> which is used to store
the value defered upon a trigger call. The first call to <methodname>eval()</methodname>
does not store the value itself but a reference to the variable.

To store the actual value a stub class like <classname>TriggerStub</classname> or
<classname>ReturnValueAndTriggerStub</classname> is then
used to trigger the copy action. This way the storing of the desired outbound value
by reference is defered until the method would really be invoked. The calls to
<methodname>eval()</methodname> are primarily to check for potential matches.
Unfortunately a temporary shared pointer variable is needed since all the objects are
completely independent from each other.

<para>The following example would trigger the contraints in parameters 2 and 3 when
the first parameters is 2:</para>

<programlisting>

  class UserInfo
  {
    virtual void vident(unsigned userno,
                        string &amp;username,
                        string &amp;useradr) = 0;
  };

  TriggeredOutbound&lt;string> *tc_a;
  TriggeredOutbound&lt;string> *tc_b;

  tc_a = new TriggeredOutbound&lt;string>("my-name");
  tc_b = new TriggeredOutbound&lt;string>("my-address");
  videnter.expects(once())
          .with(eq(2u),
                tc_a,
                tc_b)
          .will(trigger(tc_a, tc_b));

</programlisting>

</para>

</sect4>

<sect4  id="comparing-constraint">
<title>Constraints for Comparison</title>

<para>&mockpp; contains two constraint classes to compare objects.
<classname>IsEqual</classname> is probably appropriate for most cases. It takes
an object and stores it's value for later comparison.</para>

<para><classname>IsSame</classname> on the other hand is intended to check
for identical values. This usually means to compare the pointer values
of two objects. There is a template function
<function>isSameComparison</function> which implements this default behaviour.
If you need a differing implementation for a certain class you can provide
a specialised template. This may happen if you are using a shared pointer and
don't want to compare the helper but the shared object at the end of
the pointers.</para>

<para>For a similar reason there is another templated function
named <function>isEqualComparison</function>. Both functions are
useful if you need to compare objects but can't or don't want to
implement the according <function>operator==</function>.</para>

<para>
<note>
<title>Potential backwards compatibility break</title>
<para>&mockpp; up to version 1.9.3 implemented
<classname>IsEqual</classname> and <classname>IsSame</classname>
in exactly the same manner.
Unfortunately this may now lead to dangling pointers and crashes if
existing code refers to temporary objects.</para>

<para>The following fragment shows the problem. When constructing
the object a temporary string is created and this pointer is
passed to the constructor of <classname>IsEqual</classname>.
After this statement the string object is destroyed and this pointer becomes
invalid.

<programlisting>

   IsSame&lt;std::string&gt; same ("string");

</programlisting>

To avoid this problem you have to create a variable which must exist
until the test completes.

<programlisting>

   std::string str ("string");
   IsSame&lt;std::string&gt; same (str);

</programlisting>

</para>

<sect3>
<title>Custom Matchers</title>

<para>The former sections explained standard methods for common use. But it is also possible to create
your own rules for matching an invocation. If your rules depend on the parameters passed
to the mocked method derive your custom class from <classname>InvocationMatcher</classname>.
If it is independent from the parameters use <classname>TypelessMatcher</classname> instead. To
express the non-standard use you should then pass the object to method
<methodname>match()</methodname>.</para>

<para> But please keep in mind that custom matchers can virtually do everything. Most of the
time you want to check method parameters and therefor you probably should create a
constraint class derived from <classname>Constraint&lt;T></classname>. See also the
files below <filename>mockpp/constraint</filename> as a starting point.</para>

</sect3>


<sect3>
<title>Return Values and Exceptions</title>

<para>Return values from methods and exceptions are treated similar. Exceptions are
considered not more than a special kind of return value. You may determine the return value
based on the result of the parameters you passed with <methodname>expects()</methodname>
and <methodname>with()</methodname> or you can optionally set a default action
by passing it to <methodname>setDefaultStub()</methodname>.
The default action takes place when no other expectation matches.</para>

<para>If you have a sequence of return values that shall be returned in subsequent
invocations you can use a short hand method and pass
the values via <methodname>onConsecutiveCalls()</methodname> to
<methodname>will()</methodname>.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Create a Chainer Object Using Macros</title>

<para>
To get a chainable mock object you must:
<itemizedlist>
 <listitem>Derive and define your object with the methods you need</listitem>
 <listitem>Create a chainer for each method and set up the behaviour</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

is to replace the macros and the resulting chainer object with the method object
