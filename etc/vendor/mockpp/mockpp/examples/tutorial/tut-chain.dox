\section chain_mo Solution 3a: Chainable Mock Objects With Macros

After including the the \c mockpp header files some elements from the \c mockpp namespace
which will be needed later
are imported to omit the prefix and enhance readability.

\code
using mockpp::eq;
using mockpp::exactly;
using mockpp::returnValue;
using mockpp::throwException;
\endcode

A more convenient way is to place a \c #define before including the mockpp headers
which imports all these shortcut functions into the global namespace:

\code
#define MOCKPP_IMPORT_ABBREVIATED
#include <mockpp/chaining/ChainingMockObjectSupport.h>
\endcode

The next solution of the know testing problem
uses another type of advanced mock objects. It is called
<em>ChainableMockObject</em> because the expectations are created by chaining
method calls to a temporary object that moves the sub-expectations into the
container mock object.

The class is implemented similar to the previous example.
Only the names differ slightly. Every \c VISITABLE is replaced by
\c CHAINABLE .

\code
class ChainMock : public Interface
                , public ChainableMockObject
{
  public:

    ChainMock()
      : ChainableMockObject("ChainMock", 0)
      , MOCKPP_CONSTRUCT_MEMBERS_FOR_VOID_CHAINABLE_EXT1(open, ext)
      , MOCKPP_CONSTRUCT_MEMBERS_FOR_CHAINABLE0(read)
      , MOCKPP_CONSTRUCT_MEMBERS_FOR_VOID_CHAINABLE_EXT1(write, ext)
      , MOCKPP_CONSTRUCT_MEMBERS_FOR_VOID_CHAINABLE0(close)
    {}
\endcode

The next step after implementing the mock object is similar to the previous
example, too. To
create expectations you have to use a helper object as well. In this case
a \c Chainer instead of the former \c Controller .

\code
    ChainMock mock;
    MOCKPP_CHAINER_FOR_EXT(ChainMock, open, ext) open_chainer (&mock);
\endcode

This chainer is then used to create a temporary object which helps to
pass all desired sub-expectations into the mock object. Usually you
will create one or more of the following types:

 - a number indicating how often the ecpectation is used
 - a constraint for each parameter of the call
 - a return value or an exception to throw
 - a unique label to reference the expectation

When a method is invoked on a mock object, the mock object searches
through its expectations from first to last (in the order of your source code)
to find one that matches the
invocation. An expectation matches an invocation if all of its
matching rules match the invocation. After the invocation, the matching expectation
might stop matching
further invocations. For example, an \c expects(once())
expectation only matches once and will be ignored on future invocations while an
\c expects(atLeastOnce())
expectation will always be matched against invocations.

At the end of the test cycle all expectations have to be "consumed" for a successful
result.

So he following code is quite easy to read: the method is expected to
be invoked exactly once with a parameter equal to "file1.lst". And the the call
must happen before another call labelled "reader".

\code
    open_chainer.expects(once())
                .with(eq(std::string("file1.lst")))
                .before("reader");
\endcode

Chainable mock objects provide a method \c stubs() as well as a method \c expects(). Internally both do
exactly the same. The main difference is more of a syntactical nature. Expectations expressed
with \c stubs
should be used when the main intent is to return values. Whereas \c expects() is prefered when the
focus lies on checking parameters. Another difference is the optional parameter to \c stubs() .
If this parameter is missing the expecation is optional and has unlimited lifetime. Therefor it is
no error of the stub is not called at all.

To set up a method to return a value you might choose one of the patterns below.
The first call passes only one argument and the second creates a sequence of three values
which will be returned one after the other.

\code
    read_chainer.stubs()
                .will(new ReturnStub<std::string>("record-1"));

    read_chainer.stubs()
                .will(onConsecutiveCalls(new ReturnStub<std::string>("record-1"),
                                         new ReturnStub<std::string>("record-2"),
                                         new ReturnStub<std::string>("record-3")));
\endcode

\section chain_examples More elaborate examples

It is possible to re-write the examples from the previous section.

First the \c add() method is replaced. Two expected calls with parameters are
prepared together with the correct return value:

 - \c add(1,2) ==> 3
 - \c add(99,11) ==> 110

The last statement sets the default return value -1.

\code
  add_chainer.stubs()
             .with(eq(1), eq(2))
             .will(returnValue(3));

  add_chainer.stubs()
             .with(eq(99), eq(11))
             .will(returnValue(110));

  add_chainer.stubs()
             .will(returnValue(-1));
\endcode

The next example rewrites the \c network_read() method. As before the method shall return 10 times
with a 0, then an NetworkError shall be thrown and all later calls shall return 1:

\code
    read_chainer.stubs(exactly(10))
                .will(returnValue(0));

    read_chainer.stubs(once())
                .will(throwException<int>(NetworkError()));

    read_chainer.stubs()
                .will(returnValue(1));
\endcode
