\section basic_mo Solution 1: Basic Mock Objects

The first solution will use basic mock objects to express the needed expectations.
Additionally there is a container object to hold and verify all those tiny mock
objects. The container must inherit from the \c Interface class as well as
from the root of all more advanced mock objects \c MockObject :

\code
class BasicMock : public Interface
                , public MockObject
{
  public:
\endcode

In the next step the constructor is added which also initializes
all sub-expectations. All objects should get a meaningful
name to identify them in debug output when errors occur. Additionally
they are registered with the container mock object. It might be
a good idea to use some kind of hierarchical naming scheme to identify
the sub-objects within the surrounding container object as shown below.

\code
    BasicMock()
      : MockObject("BasicMock", 0)
      , open_name("BasicMock/open_name", this)
      , close_counter("BasicMock/close_counter", this)
      , write_data("BasicMock/write_data", this)
      , read_data("BasicMock/read_data", this)
    {
    }
\endcode

Every call to one of the methods will be checked by an adequate expectation type.
Depending on your personal taste you can simply use public member variables or hide
them and offer getter and setter methods.

To verify the calls to \c open() a \c ExpectationList is used. This way
all the actual values are checked against the expectations one after the other.
As a side effect the total number of calls to \c open() is verified since
the count of actual and expected values have to be equal.

\code
    ExpectationList<std::string> open_name;

    virtual void open(const std::string &name)
    {
      open_name.addActual(name);
    }
\endcode

The implementation of method \c read() needs a different approach. To return
a predefined set of values an object of type \c ReturnObjectList is
used. And again the additional benefit is the fact that the total number of
calls must equal the number of return values.

\code
    ReturnObjectList<std::string> read_data;

    virtual std::string read()
    {
      return read_data.nextReturnObject();
    }
\endcode

A third alternative is chosen to to verify the correct number of calls to
\c close(). Since there are no parameters or return values the only
possibility is to take \c ExpectationCounter .

\code
    ExpectationCounter close_counter;

    virtual void close()
    {
      close_counter.inc();
    }
\endcode

Once the mock object is implemented you have to set up the desired behaviour.

The expected program flow covers
2 calls to \c open(): 1 for reading and 1 for writing. Each time with the same filename.
Unfortunately there is no simple way to distinguish between the different calls to
\c open() in the read and write sequence.

So 2 expected parameter values for calls to \c open() are added:

\code
    BasicMock mock;

    mock.open_name.addExpected("file1.lst");
    mock.open_name.addExpected("file1.lst");
\endcode

Next you have to provide the appropriate number of return values for the \c read() method.
They are added in the expected order to the \c ReturnObjectList :

\code
    mock.read_data.addObjectToReturn("record-1");
    mock.read_data.addObjectToReturn("record-2");
    mock.read_data.addObjectToReturn("record-3");
\endcode

While processing the records a method \c calculate is invoked several times. Since the input
can't be determined exactly a \c ConstraintList is used which verifies similar to
a ExpectationList but on the base of a mean amount and a delta value.

\code
    mock.calculate_input.addExpected(eq<unsigned>(5,5));
    mock.calculate_input.addExpected(eq<unsigned>(5,5));
    mock.calculate_input.addExpected(eq<unsigned>(5,5));
\endcode

The number of calls to \c close() must equal the calls to \c open() . For that reason
the according \c ExpectationCounter is set to 2:

\code
    mock.close_counter.setExpected(2);
\endcode

The set up code is completed with the expectations for the calls to \c write() .
The expected parameter values are added in the expected order:

\code
    mock.write_data.addExpected("record-1/processed");
    mock.write_data.addExpected("record-2/processed");
    mock.write_data.addExpected("record-3/processed");
\endcode

All the expectations for the mock object are complete. The methods under test
are invoked in the order of the production code. If any expectations are missed
 an exception
is thrown which should be caught and displayed.

\code
    Consumer consumer(&mock);
    consumer.load();
    consumer.process();
    consumer.save();
  }
  catch(std::exception &ex)
  {
    std::cout << std::endl
              << "Error occured.\n" << ex.what() << std::endl
              << std::endl;
  }
\endcode

There is one important thing remaining: there is no simple way to
automatically detect
missing actual values. The only possibility is to verify manually
after the test calls are done. The call of \c verify() in the container
mock object will then trigger the verification of all its sub-objects.

\code
    mock.verify();
\endcode
