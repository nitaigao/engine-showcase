\section visit2_mo Solution 2b: Visitable Mock Methods

The former approach to set up a visitable mock objects with macros
needs few lines of code and works fine if you do everything right.

But a big disadvantage is the fact that it is really hard to find
compiler errors as all messages refer to the same line. For the same
reason it is almost impossible to use a debugger and step through the
code and follow the execution path.

A better solution is the use of mock methods. They act similar to the code
behind the macros but are based on templates. There are only little
changes. Most of the work is it to provide some forwarder
methods.

Include the additonal top level header:

\code
#include <mockpp/CountedVisitableMethod.h>
\endcode

Instead of providing the members wrapped in macros add the mock method
objects.

\code
class VisitMock : public Interface
                , public VisitableMockObject
{
  public:

    VisitMock()
      : VisitableMockObject("VisitMock", 0)
      , open_mocker("open", this)
      , read_mocker("read", this)
      , write_mocker("write", this)
      , close_mocker("close", this)
      , calculate_mocker("calculate", this)
    {}
\endcode

Implementing the methods within the mock object is easy as they only
forward to their mock method object.

\code
    void open(const std::string &filename)
    {
      open_mocker.forward(filename);
    }

    std::string read()
    {
      return read_mocker.forward();
    }
\endcode

If you intend to use constraints to make your tests less strict you need
to add an overloaded method which forwards the constraint object. Note that
this method may only be called in record mode and never returns a value.

\code
    unsigned calculate(unsigned input)
    {
      return calculate_mocker.forward(input);
    }

    void calculate(const ConstraintHolder<unsigned> &ch)
    {
      calculate_mocker.forward(ch);
    }
\endcode

To finally complete the class definition you have to declare the mock
methods.

\code
    VisitableMockMethod<void, std::string>   open_mocker;
    VisitableMockMethod<std::string>         read_mocker;
    VisitableMockMethod<void, std::string>   write_mocker;
    VisitableMockMethod<void>                close_mocker;
    VisitableMockMethod<unsigned, unsigned>  calculate_mocker;
\endcode

Now as everything is prepared you set up the behaviour. This happens
almost exactly as before when using macros. Instead of using a controller
object you use the mock methods directly. For convenience, in case you
have rather long names as in the example, you can use a reference as well.

\code
    VisitMock mock;

    VisitableMockMethod<std::string>        &reader (mock.read_mocker);
    VisitableMockMethod<unsigned, unsigned> &calcer (mock.calculate_mocker);
\endcode

The actual setup is done with exactly the same methods as before with
the macros.

\code
    mock.open("file1.lst");
    mock.read();
    mock.read();
    mock.read();
    mock.close();

    reader.addReturnValue("record-1");
    reader.addReturnValue("record-2");
    reader.addReturnValue("record-3");
\endcode
