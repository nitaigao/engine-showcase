\section poor_mo Solution 4: Poor Man's Mock Objects

Often, maybe most of the time, you don't need a full-featured mock object library.
If you only want to make sure a method is invoked at all a simple boolean flag with
a self-made mock object suffices. If you want to track invocation order you might
extend this a bit and store a counter value for each method. Each call to any of
the methods increments the counter.

Such a mock object may have really little
functionality, exactly what is really needed. The following code shows how this
could look like.

First the variables are declared. For simplicity all those variables have
public access.

\code
class PoorMock : public Interface
{
  public:

    unsigned counter;
    unsigned open_counter;
    unsigned read_counter;
    unsigned write_counter;
    unsigned close_counter;
\endcode

The constructor resets all the variables for determined results:

\code
    PoorMock()
    {
      counter = 0;
      open_counter = 0;
      read_counter = 0;
      write_counter = 0;
      close_counter = 0;
    }
\endcode

Then each method invocation stores the current counter value in the according variable
and increments the counter afterwards.

\code
    virtual void open(const std::string &name)
    {
      open_counter = ++counter;
    }
\endcode

If a method returns a value it may suffice to return the same value all the
time if the method is only called once. Otherwise a simple array or a std::vector
might already provide enough convenience for a set of values.

\code
    virtual std::string read()
    {
      read_counter = ++counter;
      return "dummy";
    }
\endcode

After the methods have been invokedin the test
the according counters are checked for the expected value. Since this approach is
really simple it may become necessary to check more often to better locate
problems. The asserter may also be simple and terminate the application
after printing the error.

\code
  Consumer consumer(&mock);
  consumer.load();

  ASSERTER(mock.open_counter == 1);
  ASSERTER(mock.read_counter == 4);
  ASSERTER(mock.close_counter == 5);

  consumer.process();
  consumer.save();

  ASSERTER(mock.open_counter == 6);
  ASSERTER(mock.write_counter == 9);
  ASSERTER(mock.close_counter == 10);
\endcode
