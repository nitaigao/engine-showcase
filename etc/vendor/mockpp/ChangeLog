                            mockpp history
                            --------------


2008-05-30  1.16.5

 - in contructor of DefaultResultStub initialize default value
 - output names of generated files in gen_xxx.pl
 - always regenerate current test files below generator/xml2mockpp
 - optionally different methods for Constraints when adding values and
   when verify-ing in the end.
 - fixes for g++-4.3
 - OutBound, And, Or, IsNot overwrite verify() instad of using eval()
 - classes Or and And offer full and shortcut evaluation
