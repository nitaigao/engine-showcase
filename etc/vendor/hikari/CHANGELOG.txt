Current Version: Hikari v0.4

API Changes since v0.3:
- In HikariManager:
-- HikariManager::createFlashOverlay has an extra parameter, 'tier'
-- HikariManager::getFocusedControl has been added
- In FlashControl:
-- FlashControl::setPosition has been added
-- FlashControl::resetPosition has been added
-- FlashControl::getCoordinates has been added

Core Changes since v0.3:
- Tiered z-ordering has been implemented. When an overlay is focused, it is still popped to the front but it now stays within its tier (there are a total of six possible tiers, specified within the range [0, 5]). This feature makes it possible to group layers of overlays together (to say, keep all the background overlays from the foreground overlays).

Bugfixes since v0.3:
- The dimensions of a certain temporary render buffer were being improperly defined as a static variable instead of as a member variable-- causing undefined behavior when multiple FlashControls were instantiated. This bug has been fixed (thanks truwater).

Current Version: Hikari v0.3

-- FlashControl::getName has been added
-- FlashControl::getExtents has been added
-- FlashControl::setDraggable has been added

- In HikariManager:
-- HikariManager::injectKeyEvent has been added
-- HikariManager::injectMouseWheel has been added
-- HikariManager::setKeyboardHookEnabled has been added
-- HikariManager::destroyAllControls has been added
-- HikariManager::createFlashOverlay now allows automatic z-order incrementation
- Added enum 'ScaleMode'

Core Changes since v0.2:
- FlashValue now supports value-type interpretation
- Removed dependency upon shlwapi.
- As a workaround for better IME support, you may now disable the internal keyboard-hook and inject keyboard/IME messages directly from the main window's WindowProc.
- Alpha-picking (the filtering of mouse clicks by transparency) is now implemented.
- In the HikariManager, global mouse-movement events are now broadcast to all Flash overlays instead of only the top-most control
- Mouse-wheel injection is now supported

Bugfixes since v0.2:
- FlashControl overlays weren't being sorted correctly by z-order during focus, this has been fixed.
- Patched up a memory leak in FlashControl, thanks to Adis.
- Applied a potential workaround for heap corruption due to Ogre::DisplayString in FlashControl::callFunction.
- Applied a potential fix for certain FlashControl destruction assertions.
- Fixed a bug with transmitting apostrophes using FlashControl::callFunction and function callbacks.
- Made FlashValue more compatible with major string types.

Demo changes since v0.2:
- Removed dependency upon the Terrain Scene Manager.
