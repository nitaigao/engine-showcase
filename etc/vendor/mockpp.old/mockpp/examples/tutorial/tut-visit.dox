\section visit_mo Solution 2a: Visitable Mock Objects With Macros

In the previous example each sub-expectation was created and adjusted manually.
To reduce the code needed to set up the desired behaviour \c mockpp provides advanced
mock objects. One of them uses the <em>visitable</em> approach. The name is derived
from the fact that the behaviour is set up using some king of recording machanism,
or by <em>visting</em> the mock object.

First the a container mock object must be implemeneted. Similar to the first solution
is must inherit from \c Interface and from \c VisitableMockObject .
All the functionality is hidden in internal variables and helper methods. There is a set
of variables for each method which must be initialized in the constructor. This work
is done with a macro. The macro name depends on the type of method and the number of
parameters it takes. You can read more about the details in the
<a href="../handbook/ch01s03.html#choosing_macro" >handbook</a>.

\code
class VisitMock : public Interface
                , public VisitableMockObject
{
  public:

    VisitMock()
      : VisitableMockObject("VisitMock", 0)
      , MOCKPP_CONSTRUCT_MEMBERS_FOR_VOID_VISITABLE_EXT1(open, ext)
      , MOCKPP_CONSTRUCT_MEMBERS_FOR_VISITABLE0(read)
      , MOCKPP_CONSTRUCT_MEMBERS_FOR_VOID_VISITABLE_EXT1(write, ext)
      , MOCKPP_CONSTRUCT_MEMBERS_FOR_VOID_VISITABLE0(close)
    {}
\endcode

Then the methods are implemented. The according code for the variables and
helper methods is also hidden in macros. In the simplest case you only have to
pick the according macro and add the name of the class and the method.
So the definition for method \c close() is easy:

\code
    MOCKPP_VOID_VISITABLE0(VisitMock, close);
\endcode

If the method has a non standard type (according to the definition of \c mockpp)
you need an extended set of macros. The same applies to overloaded methods.
This is necessary because the internal variables and names are derived from
the methods name and parameters but need special handling.
This is also explained in the according section of the
<a href="../handbook/ch01s03.html#choosing_macro" >handbook</a>.

\code
    MOCKPP_VOID_VISITABLE_EXT1(VisitMock, open, const std::string &,
                                          ext,  std::string);
\endcode

Once the class is finished and ready to use the desired behaviour must be set up.
This is done by invoking the expected methods with the expected parameters.
In the example the file is opened, three lines are read and the file is closed.

\code
    VisitMock mock;

    mock.open("file1.lst");
    mock.read();
    mock.read();
    mock.read();
    mock.close();
\endcode

When you want to prepare the return values for the method \c read() you
use a helper object which passes the values via helper methods in the desired
order into the mock object.

\code
    MOCKPP_CONTROLLER_FOR(VisitMock, read) read_controller (&mock);

    read_controller.addReturnValue("record-1");
    read_controller.addReturnValue("record-2");
    read_controller.addReturnValue("record-3");
\endcode

After all the behaviour is added you have to switch the mock object
into test mode by invoking \c activate() . Then you run the methods
under test. Similar to the first example you should call \c verify() at the
end to check for pending expectations.

\code
    mock.activate();

    Consumer consumer(&mock);
    consumer.load();
    consumer.process();
    consumer.save();

    mock.verify();
  }
  catch(std::exception &ex)
  {
    std::cout << std::endl
              << "Error occured.\n" << ex.what() << std::endl
              << std::endl;
  }
\endcode

\section visit_enh Enhanced functionality

Visitable mock objects offer some more functionality. Suppose you have a method
\c add() which receives two parameters and returns the sum.You could emulate this behaviour
for some expected values by using the following statements. Additionally the method shall
return -1 as error indicator for all other parameters. As an alternative
you could have it throw an exception by using \c setDefaultThrowable().

\code
    MOCKPP_CONTROLLER_FOR(VisitMock, add) add_controller (&mock);

    add_controller.addResponseValue(3, 1, 2);      // 1 and 2 are expected
    add_controller.addResponseValue(110, 99, 11);  // 99 and 11 are expected
    add_controller.setDefaultReturnValue(-1);
\endcode

Another rather common problem is the simulation of runtime errors. Such errors happen
usually when you don't expect them but you hardly can reproduce them. To address such
testing problems you might use a \c Throwable . The following code could
be used to emulate a method that returns bytes from a network connection. The first 10
calls return 0, but the next call throws a \c NetworkError . All the following
calls return 1.

\code
    class NetworkError {};

    MOCKPP_CONTROLLER_FOR(VisitMock, network_read) read_controller (&mock);

    read_controller.addReturnValue(0, 10);
    read_controller.addThrowable(make_throwable(NetworkError()));
    read_controller.setDefaultValue(1);
\endcode

When generating such behaviour you should keep in mind that there is a determined
dispatching order which is explained in the
<a href="../handbook/ch01s03s02.html#visit-order" >VisitableMockObject section</a>
of the handbook.

Since the parameters passed to \c calculate are not exactly defined we must implement
some tolerance. This can be achieved with an according constraint. In this case
\c IsCloseTo which allows a delta value.

\code
    mock.calculate(eq<unsigned>(5,5));
    mock.calculate(eq<unsigned>(5,5));
    mock.calculate(eq<unsigned>(5,5));
\endcode

Another constraint is used to verify the data that is written back. The important part is
the appended string "processed" so only this substring is verified:

\code
    mock.write(stringContains(std::string("processed")));
    mock.write(stringContains(std::string("processed")));
\endcode

In a similar manner the return value can be influenced by passing the controller object
according constraints instead of exact values.

\code
    calculate_controller.addResponseValue(10, eq<unsigned>(2,2));
    calculate_controller.addResponseValue(20, eq<unsigned>(4,2));
    calculate_controller.addResponseValue(30, eq<unsigned>(6,2));
\endcode
