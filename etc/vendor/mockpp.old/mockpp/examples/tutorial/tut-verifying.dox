\section verifying   Using Verifying Test Cases

Having every object correctly verified is something you might regularly forget.
To support this a bit, there is a special class \c mockpp::VerifyingTestCase. Using it
ensures that all expectations are verifyied at the end of the call. It also reminds you, if
you have not registered any object. This also implies that you have to take another registering
macro if you don't want the automatic verification for a certain method.

The class
is based on CppUnit and works very similarly. There is a macro for verifying
and non-verifying test methods as well as for the (in CppUnit deprecated) tests that
check for thrown eceptions.

\code
class VerifyingCalculator_test : public mockpp::VerifyingTestCase
{
 public:
   CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE( VerifyingCalculator_test );
     MOCKPP_TEST(test_no_verify);
     MOCKPP_VERIFYING_TEST(test_ok);
     MOCKPP_TEST_EXCEPTION(test_fail_no_verify, mockpp::AssertionFailedError);
     MOCKPP_VERIFYING_TEST_EXCEPTION(test_fail, mockpp::AssertionFailedError);
   CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_END();
\endcode

For automatic verification all your expectations have to be created on the
heap with \c new and registered with the surrounding mock object.
This is a bit inconvenient but necessary to extend the lifetime of the expectations
beyond the return of the test method.

\code
void VerifyingCalculator_test::test_ok()
{
  mockpp::ExpectationValue<int> *ev = new mockpp::ExpectationValue<int> ("ev") ;
  registerVerifiable(ev);

  ev->setExpected(123);
  ev->setActual(123);
}
\endcode
